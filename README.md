Wikipedia Search is an application that allows the user to search for articles on Wikipedia that match certain keywords.

Project for FreeCodeCamp's [Front-End Web Development Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.com/about)

## Objective

Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/wGqEga/.

## Rules
- **Rule \#1**: Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.
- **Rule \#2**: Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

## User stories
- **User Story**: I can search Wikipedia entries in a search box and see the resulting Wikipedia entries.
- **User Story**: I can click a button to see a random Wikipedia entry.

## Hints 
- Hint \#1: Here's a URL you can use to get a random Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random.
- Hint \#2: Here's an entry on using Wikipedia's API: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page.
- Hint \#3: Use this link to experiment with Wikipedia's API.
